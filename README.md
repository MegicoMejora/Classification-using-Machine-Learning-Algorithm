# Classification-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm

This project is a Classfication problem done by using different Machine Learning Algorithms. 

For the different features present in the dataset, the data is classified whether it belongs to True or False class.

Different steps involved in this project are,

1. Data Preprocessing

2. Feature Scaling

3. Model Building

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Imputation methods were used to resolve missing values present in the dataset. 

Converting categorical values to numeric values using Label Encoder.

### 2. Feature Scaling

Features were scaled using Standarization

### 3. Model Building

After experimenting with different Machine Learning Algorithms the three models were selected.

1. Decision tree

2.Random forest

3. SVM

Three models were trained and validated and the best model was tested using the test dataset.

The explanation can be found from the Juypter Notebook.
